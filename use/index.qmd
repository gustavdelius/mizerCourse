title: "Part 3: Use mizer models"
---

Now that you have built your model, you can use it to explore the effects of changes in fishing and changes in the environment on the fish community and the fisheries yield. 


### Tutorials

Using examples, the tutorials are designed to help you develop your own model simulation experiments:

1.  [**Simulate fishing scenarios**](fishing-scenarios.qmd)\
    We assess how the system responds to changes in fishing through time. This step involves looking closer at the fishing parameters in mizer and setting up different fishing scenarios.

2.  [**Change resources**](change-resources.qmd)\
    Next we look at the resource spectrum and how changes in three main resource parameters can affect our ecosystem. We will also show an example of how to use external data on resource time series to force the mizer model.

3.  [**Explore further scenarios**](further-scenarios.qmd)\
    This tutorial provides extra material, prepared by Julia Blanchard using another system (Patagonian toothfish fishery) as an example. Here you can learn on how to set time series of fishing changes and more.

### Video overview

The following video by Julia Blanchard provides a broad overview of the different ways in which mizer is being used to help understand the consequences of change in aquatic ecosystems. There are a lot of ways!
