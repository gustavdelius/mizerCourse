title: "Part 2: Build mizer models"
---

Now that you have a good understanding of the basic principles behind sized based models, in this part of the course you will start developing our own multi-species model. You are welcome to use your own model system in this section, assuming you have the data. Alternatively, you can follow our example and focus on a model for the Celtic Sea. 

The material is split into 4 tutorials:

1.  [**Finding species parameters**](find-species-parameters.qmd)\
    Here we will explore the main species parameters that should be provided by the user to start building a multi-species model. We will also look at assumptions and defaults that mizer uses to fill non-essential parameter values. Your task will be to collect essential parameters from FishBase or other sources. 

2.  [**Create your first model**](create-first-model.qmd)\
    Now that you have species parameters you can build the first model. In this part we will focus on achieving the correct species abundances and growth rates.
    
3.  [**Refine your model: diet data**](refine-diet.qmd)\
    In this tutorial we will introduce the `tuneParams()` shiny gadget which makes it much easier to make changes to model parameters and observe their effects on the system. We will use it to explore how the diet emerges in the model from the interplay between predation preference and prey abundance and adjust the model parameters to reproduce observed diets. 
    
3.  [**Refine your model: landings data**](refine-landings.qmd)\
    Finally we will tune the model parameters to make the model predictions for the catches agree with landings data, in particular the size distribution of the landings. We will again be using the `tuneParams()` gadget.
